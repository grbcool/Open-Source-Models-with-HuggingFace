# Open-Source-Models-with-HuggingFace
Deeplearning.ai Short Practical Course on how to use open source models from Hugging Face Hub to perform NLP, audio, image and multimodal tasks using the Hugging Face transformers library.

# Learnings

- Use the transformers library to turn a small language model into a chatbot capable of multi-turn conversations to answer follow-up questions.
- Translate between languages, summarize documents, and measure the similarity between two pieces of text, which can be used for search and retrieval.
- Convert audio to text with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and convert text to audio using Text to Speech (TTS).
- Perform zero-shot audio classification, to classify audio without fine-tuning the model.
- Generate an audio narration describing an image by combining object detection and text-to-speech models.  
- Identify objects or regions in an image by prompting a zero-shot image segmentation model with points to identify the object that you want to select.
- Implement visual question answering, image search, image captioning and other multimodal tasks.
- Share your AI app using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces to run your applications in a user-friendly interface on the cloud or as an API.
